# Real-time-gun-detection-using-surveillance-camera
#### Problem Statement: 
Gun violence in shops remains stubbornly high, despite decades of gun control efforts. Many gun-related crimes, including armed assault and robbery, occur in shops with existing surveillance systems. However, most systems rely on constant human supervision; this often demands an unrealistic amount of vigilance and can be expensive and ineffective when multiple video streams are present. The increase of video surveillance in public spaces and the proliferation of body cameras for police can potentially be leveraged for gun detection systems. Video systems could alert police and surveillance personnel when a gun is detected in real time, resulting in prompter action.

#### Aim and Objective: 
The aim of this project is to propose a method to detect a particular kind of a weapon carried by a person in a low-resolution image such as CCTV image. The objective to be achieved are: 
1. Detection of human in an image.
2. Detection of segment containing Knife in the detected image segment containing human.
3. Extraction of feature for each segment. 
4. Design a multiclass classifier to detect guns and person wearing mask.

#### Expected Output: 
When a person enters the store with mask or carrying a gun it will detect it from the live CCTV Footage and send a alert message to the specified mobile number or nearby police station.
